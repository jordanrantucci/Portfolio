# React Portfolio

## Description 

This is a CWRU coding bootcamp homework assignment practicing using React.  The application's UI is divided into several components that have managed states.  They are able to responde to the user events of filtering and sorting.

AS A USER I would like an application that is an employee directory that can quickly acces information on a list of personnel.  The User can view the entire directory and be able to filter by first or last name and sort first name alphabetically.
